## Usage

### Download files
Run `yarn add storiesjs` in the terminal. 
Then, add
```
<script src="<node_modules>/storiesjs/dist/stories.bundle.js"></script>
```
to your website.

### "CDN"

If you don't want to download the files, just add the following line to your website:
```
<script src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/j0zdbngb4fl5oim/stories.bundle.js?dl=0"></script>
```
Be warned that this method is not stable at all.
